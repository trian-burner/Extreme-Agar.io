 * The Virus class is the smallest cell's savior, and the largest cell's excecutioner.  
 * It can hide small cells underneath itself, providing a hiding place that can be used as a getaway, or as a trap. 
 * When a player consumes a cell, it will split them into 7 smaller copies, allowing all the smaller cells to quickly consume the player.
 * This then provides a sheild for small cells, since large cells are unlikely to pursue them, and a sword the player can grow, as the virus launch will split at a certain mass
 * and will lauch its copy in a random direction.
